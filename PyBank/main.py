# First we need to import the csv file of our data
import os

import csv

# Next we need to establish the path
csvpath = os.path.join('..', 'Resources', 'budget_data.csv')

# I think we need to define variables here? Maybe? Or maybe we creates lists to store the data, is there a difference?
Date = [1]

"Profit/Losses" = [2]


# Count the things, and by things, I mean the number of months in the data set
    # find the first row of data
    # find the last row of data

# Calculate the net gain or loss over the period
    # Find the first value in the gain or loss column
    # Find the last value in the gain or loss column 
    # calculate using those values the net gain or loss

#Calculate the average of changes in "Profit/Losses" over the time period
    # Now how the fuck do we do that arghhh
    # Do some fancy-schmancy calculations I guess... computer do the thing!!!

# Greatest increase in profits,
    # Use a while loop to look for greatest value
    # Print greatest value
    # Print date it occured
    # Print amount

# Greatest decrease in losses
    # Use a while loop to look for lowest value
    # Print lowest value
    # Print date it occured
    # Print amount

# We need to print the analysis to terminal
# Lastly we need to export our analysis as a text file
